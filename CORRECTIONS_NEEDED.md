# Corrections Needed from Ishan's Edited Document

## Red Text Corrections (Numbers to Fix)

### 1. Timeline Correction
**Line 16**: "Average Monthly Burn: $7,463 (Jan-Jun 2026)"
- **WRONG**: Jan-Jun 2025
- **CORRECT**: Jan-Jun 2026
- **Issue**: Timeline shifted forward by 1 year

### 2. Revenue Projections - All Wrong
**Lines 23-26**: Projected Jan '26 Revenue numbers
- Projected Jan '26 Revenue: $10,609
- Registration Fees: $9,645
- Admin Fees: $965
- Market Placement: $96

**ISSUE**: These numbers need to be recalculated from the V3 model

### 3. Revenue in Path to Profitability
**Line 43**: "$10.6k from Courbet fees"
- **Issue**: Needs verification against actual model

### 4. Monthly Revenue KPI
**Line 70**: "✓ $10k+ monthly revenue"
- **Issue**: Needs verification

### 5. Year 1 Revenue
**Line 95**: "Revenue: $500k+ (conservative, based on 3 mines)"
- **WRONG**: Previous estimate
- **CORRECT**: Needs calculation from V3 model for 3 mines in 2026

### 6. Year 2 Revenue
**Line 99**: "Revenue: $1.5m+ (based on 6-9 mines onboarded)"
- **WRONG**: Previous estimate
- **CORRECT**: Needs calculation from V3 model for 6-9 mines
